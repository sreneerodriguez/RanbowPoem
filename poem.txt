The rainbow and the unicorn and the ponies

this is my poem about rainbows and unicorns and ponies in the pony branch

I like rainbows. 
They have many colors.
Red
Orange
Yellow
Green
Blue
Indigo
Violet
Unicorn

I love rainbows lalala

These are the colors of the rainbow
and the unicorn
and the ponies, who were friends with the unicorn 

I wanted to add another line because rainbows are pretty.

This is my second change because I really like rainbows.
